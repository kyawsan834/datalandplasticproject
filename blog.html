                    <h3>Reducing plastic by Canada</h3>
                    <p>In May 2021, Canada declared plastic a “toxic” substance, paving the way for its proposed ban on most single-use plastics by the end of the year. This would be the most ambitious move yet by any country in the war against plastic.
                        Canada, which has the world’s longest coastline at 151,019 miles and a quarter of the world’s fresh water, currently recycles only around nine percent of its disposable plastics. Without a drastic change, it would be on track to
                        throw away $11 billion (£8.6 billion) worth of disposable plastic by 2030.</p>

                    <p>Rwanda became the world’s first ‘plastic-free’ nation in 2009, 10 years after it introduced a ban on all plastic bags and plastic packaging. Anyone who is caught with a plastic item faces a jail sentence of up to six months. On entering
                        a border post into the country, vehicles are searched and any plastic bags or packaging are confiscated before they enter the country.</p>

                    <p>India shocked the world in 2017 when it announced it would eliminate all single-use plastic by 2022. The proposed first phase of the ban, set to begin on 30 September 2021, will target thin plastic carrier bags (the hardest to recycle).
                        On 1 January 2022, six categories of single-use plastic – including earbuds with plastic sticks, plastic sticks for balloons, plastic flags, candy sticks, ice-cream sticks and polystyrene (PS) for decoration – are to be banned.
                        And a third and final stage, to take effect on 1 July 2022, will see plastic plates, glasses, cutlery, plastic stirrers, packaging films on sweet boxes, invitation cards, cigarette packets, and thin plastic banners outlawed. The
                        policy is, however, widely expected to be met with fierce opposition from plastics manufacturers across the country.</p>

                    <h3>Reducing plastic by Kenya</h3>
                    <p>Set in August 2017, Kenya’s plastic bag ban is widely regarded as the strictest in the world. Anyone found producing, selling – or even just carrying – a plastic bag faces up to four years’ imprisonment, or a fine of up to $40,000
                        (£31,000). The only exemption is for manufacturers who use polythene to wrap products. The ban appears to be working with a dramatic decline in the number of bags littering Kenya’s shanty towns – particularly “flying toilets”,
                        where residents defecate in a plastic bag, tie it up and then throw it on to the tin roofs. In June 2020, Kenya also banned the use of all single-use plastics in protected areas.</p>

                    <h3>Reducing plastic by Germany</h3>
                    <p>In Germany, a deposit return scheme was introduced in 2003 where customers pay a 25 cent (22 pence) deposit on every bottle of soft or alcoholic drink. This excludes milk, baby products and medical liquids. The move has seen almost
                        99 per cent of the country’s plastic bottles returned for recycling. Since the introduction of the scheme, an estimated 1.2 billion containers have been diverted from landfill. Glass bottles are also subject to the scheme and typically
                        have a deposit of between eight and 15 cents (seven to 13 pence) added to their cost. Once they are collected, they are typically sent back to manufacturers for cleaning and refilling. In July 2021, Germany banned the sale of single-use
                        plastic straws, cutlery, cotton buds and food containers in line with an EU-wide directive intended to reduce plastic waste.</p>

                    <h3>Reducing plastic by France</h3>
                    <p>In 2016, France became the first country in the world to ban the manufacture and sale of single-use plastic cups, cutlery, plates, and takeaway food boxes. The law requires all disposable tableware to be made from 50 per cent bio-sourced
                        materials that can be composted at home. This rises to 60 per cent by 2025. The legislation was passed after statistics from the French Association of Health and Environment revealed that only one per cent of the 4.73 billion single-use
                        plastic cups thrown away each year in France were recycled. France also banned shops from distributing plastic bags in 2016 in a bid to reduce the 17 billion which were used nationwide annually. Of those 17 billion bags, eight
                        billion were estimated to be littered annually before the ban. Most shops now offer either paper bags or reusable plastic alternatives, at a cost of a few cents each, and encourage customers to reuse their bags.</p>
